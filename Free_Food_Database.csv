More information on yuniya edi kwon: yuniya edi kwon (b. 1989 – aka eddy kwon) is a violinist, vocalist, and interdisciplinary artist based in Lenapehoking, or New York City. Her practice connects composition, improvisation, movement, and ceremony to explore transformation & transgression, ritual practice as a tool to queer ancestral lineage, and the use of mythology to connect, obscure, and reveal. As a composer-performer and improviser, she is inspired by Korean folk timbres & inflections, textures & movement from natural environments, and American experimentalism as shaped by the AACM. Her work as a choreographer and movement artist embodies an expressive release and reclamation of colonialism’s spiritual imprints, connecting to both Japanese Butoh and a lineage of queer trans practitioners of Korean shamanic ritual. She is a recipient of the 2023 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Robert Rauschenberg Award in Music/Sound, a 2023-25 Arts Fellow at Princeton University’s Lewis Center for the Arts, 2024 Civitella Ranieri Fellow, United States Artists Ford Fellow, 2022 Herb Alpert Ucross Residency Prize, Van Lier Fellow & Resident Artist at Roulette Intermedium, Johnson Fellow at Americans for the Arts, Andrew W.
