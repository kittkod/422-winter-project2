Reminiscence and Creation: Art as Memory Work 20th Annual University of Oregon Graduate Symposium in the History of Art & Architecture,April 12 2024,9:00 AM,4:30 PM,Ford Lecture Hall,"Please join the Art History Student Association for our 20th Annual History of Art and Architecture Graduate Symposium, Reminiscence and Creation: Art as Memory Work. Graduate students from around the country will be presenting their research related to themes of memories of images, people, lands, and nations, followed by a keynote lecture by Dr. Jean-Thomas Tremblay, Assistant Professor of Environmental Humanities at York University. Light breakfast and catered lunch will be provided to all attendees, with both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. Keynote Speaker: Dr. Jean-Thomas Tremblay, Assistant Professor of Environmental Humanities at York University, ""Just Sabotage."" Abstract: This essay takes, as its starting point, Andreas Malm’s effort, in his bestselling How to Blow Up a Pipeline: Learning to Fight in a World on Fire, to legitimize and normalize property destruction in the context of the climate movement. The sabotage of energy infrastructures, I counter, cannot “make sense,” for it poses a threat to coherence, removing without replacing the material and discursive conditions that grant the climate movement its meaning and purpose within late capitalism and late liberalism. Recent protests entailing the defacement of paintings share with ecocriticism an investment in an essentially liberal, pedagogical and moral covenant, one that urges witnesses to undergo an individual process of reflection in order to acquire or affirm values and priorities friendlier to the environment. Sabotage violates this covenant; blowing up a pipeline may be said to have met its goals by reducing and slowing the supply of oil, regardless of what the public learned from sabotage’s mediatization. Drawing on psychoanalytic accounts of aesthetic education, I argue that sabotage introduces absurdity into a category, action, that the climate movement otherwise insists is self-identical. Sabotage does this by subtracting the world wherein putatively future-bound actions, including having and raising a child, mean what they do. I test out this claim in a reading of Nell Zink’s novel The Wallcreeper and Benedikt Erlingsson’s film Woman at War (Kona fer í stríð), two absurdist comedies that formally amplify the semiotic crisis induced by sabotage and, in so doing, enable us to contemplate the necessary dislocation of politics from sense.

BEseries,April 16 2024,5:00 PM,7:30 PM,EMU Ballroom 1395 University Street Eugene,"Join the Student Activities Board (SAB) BEseries, and the School of Music and Dance (SOMD), and the students of the Queer and Trans Asian Pacific Islander (QTAPI) as we host eddy kwon for her BEseries dinner presentation. Eddy's presentation will draw from her course ""The Ceremony is You"" -- which connects the history of queer-trans Korean shamans to her interdisciplinary solo & collaborative work. More information on eddy kwon: yuniya edi kwon (b. 1989 – aka eddy kwon) is a violinist, vocalist, and interdisciplinary artist based in Lenapehoking, or New York City. Her practice connects composition, improvisation, movement, and ceremony to explore transformation & transgression, ritual practice as a tool to queer ancestral lineage, and the use of mythology to connect, obscure, and reveal. As a composer-performer and improviser, she is inspired by Korean folk timbres & inflections, textures & movement from natural environments, and American experimentalism as shaped by the AACM. Her work as a choreographer and movement artist embodies an expressive release and reclamation of colonialism’s spiritual imprints, connecting to both Japanese Butoh and a lineage of queer trans practitioners of Korean shamanic ritual.She is a recipient of the 2023 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Robert Rauschenberg Award in Music/Sound, a 2023-25 Arts Fellow at Princeton University’s Lewis Center for the Arts, 2024 Civitella Ranieri Fellow, United States Artists Ford Fellow, 2022 Herb Alpert Ucross Residency Prize, Van Lier Fellow & Resident Artist at Roulette Intermedium, Johnson Fellow at Americans for the Arts, Andrew W. Mellon Artist-in-Residence at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center at Colorado College, Hermitage Fellow, and a recipient of the National Performance Network Creation Fund Award. She was described as “absolutely stunning” in a feature in Wire Magazine, and was listed as one of the Washington Post’s “22 for ‘22: Composers and performers to watch this year.” In addition to an evolving, interdisciplinary solo practice, she collaborates with artists of diverse disciplines, including The Art Ensemble of Chicago, Du Yun, Holland Andrews, Tomeka Reid, Kenneth Tam, Isabel Crespo Pardo, Mariah Garnett, International Contemporary Ensemble, and as a member of the artist collective Juni One Set with Senga Nengudi and Degenerate Art Ensemble co-directors Haruko Crow Nishimura and Joshua Kohl. In 2023, eddy founded SUN HAN GUILD, a sound and performance collective with composer-improvisers Laura Cocks, Jessie Cox, DoYeon Kim, and Lester St. Louis.As a violinist, violist, and/or vocalist, she has performed alongside Roscoe Mitchell, Moor Mother, Mary Halvorson, Nicole Mitchell, Henry Threadgill, Cory Smythe, Susan Alcorn, Carla Kihlstedt, Jessika Kenney, Lesley Mok, and others. She has performed throughout the Americas and Europe, including the Kennedy Center, Big Ears Festival, Kaufman Center, Roulette Intermedium, SESC Pompeia, Barbican Centre, Jazzfest Berlin, Festival Sons d’hivers, Festival Banlieues Bleues, moers festival, and more. Commissions include Roulette Intermedium, Contemporary Arts Center Cincinnati, National Performance Network, and Colorado College Creativity & Innovation. She was born and raised in Minnesota, on the ancestral land of the Dakhóta and Anishinaabeg. Artist Statement In my life, I use sound and ritual to create spaces of intense presence and transformation. In all I do, I hope to be radically present with the ongoing, transformational miracle of life, and to share generously with others its resonances, whispers, and subterranean logics. I draw from, and am nourished by, the spiritual and cultural continuums of queer trans artist communities from around the world, and particularly the extraordinary history of trans Korean shamans active during the periods of colonization, occupation, and rebellion. Through a relational practice, I summon an opening through which I might access a creative, spiritual ancestry that can include, support, and embrace me. To share this opening with others, then, is to co-create affirming, inclusive lineages and families, and reject limiting, cisheteropatriarchal ideas of bloodlines and biological ancestry.",Student Activities Board,44.04473;,-123.073853,False

But with disruption comes opportunity, and as designers, we are uniquely situated to leverage this volatility for good. Design is an inherently optimistic practice, and while the designer as an individual may not have the power to enact significant change, design as a practice just might. HOPES is a call to pause and reflect, to purposefully embrace change and to take a collective approach to the shifting structures of our world. Together, we can begin to construct more just and sustainable future. An important step towards this future is addressing our own complicity. For years, designers have enabled flawed systems to exploit not just the resources of the natural world, but the resources of our own labor. This year, HOPES challenges designers to examine our own institutions, exploring how redefining our own modes of practice might better prepare us to do the difficult work of restructuring our institutions to better serve our sustainable goals.
